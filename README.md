# PSO2-Alert Android
The original PSO2 Alert by Arks-Layer, now for your Android device!

PSO2 Alert is designed to announce upcoming Emergency/Urgent Quests for both Japanese and Global versions of PSO2 New Genesis and Classic as well as Field Events (e.g. Gigantix) for both servers.

### Features
- Announcements for upcoming events.
- Choose which events to be notified for.
- Supports one or more server choices such as NGS Global, Global Classic, Global Field Events, NGS JP, JP Classic and/or JP Field Events.
- Announcement times in the device's timezone.
- Always ad-free with no in-app purchases or notifications not related to PSO2.

### Please note:
- Alerts are community driven and may be missed or incorrect. Contact our [Discord](https://discord.gg/pso2) if you would like to help.
- A persistent notification is required to stop the app from being killed by Android. You can long press the notification, tap on the settings icon and then uncheck "PSO2 Alert Service" to hide it. You can also set it to "Silent" if you just want to remove the icon.
- The app uses Android's Alarm Manager to perform the alert checks. This allows Android to group tasks from other apps together and thus should not cause any extra battery drain.
- Most of the features of this app are done server-side and thus it may seem like this application is rarely updated. Install it and you'll see that it works.
- Whilst the application is open-source the APIs it uses are not. Please seek permission from AIDA/Arks-Layer if you wish to use them.

### Download
You can download the latest version of the Application from the [releases](https://github.com/acffordyce973/PSO2-Alert-Android/releases) page.
